- ✋ **Gesture Recognition (via MediaPipe):**  
  Control applications, volume, and playback with hand movements.

- 📸 **Camera Feed Integration:**  
  Real-time camera processing with motion feedback.

- 🖥️ **GUI Interface:**  
  Built with **Tkinter**, providing live camera feed, console logs, and interactive control buttons.

- 💬 **Text-to-Speech (TTS):**  
  Responses and alerts via `pyttsx3`.

- 🧠 **Multithreading Support:**  
  Smooth execution of multiple tasks (voice + motion + camera).

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.12  
- **Libraries Used:**
  - `opencv-python`
  - `numpy`
  - `pyttsx3`
  - `speechrecognition`
  - `pyautogui`
  - `pillow`
  - `screeninfo`

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites
Make sure you have **Python 3.12** installed.  
If not, you can install it from:  
👉 [https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/)

---

### 2️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Jarvis3.0.git
cd Jarvis3.0


3️⃣ Install Dependencies
py -3.12 -m pip install opencv-python numpy pyttsx3 speechrecognition pyautogui pillow screeninfo keyboard pyaudio --quiet

If you want motion control (hand gestures):
py -3.12 -m pip install mediapipe


⚠️ Note: mediapipe may not be available for Python 3.13.
